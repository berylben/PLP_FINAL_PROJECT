            <p class="text-white mt-3">We conduct online meetings from time to time among the peer groups.On arrival, the patients are put into groups of at least 10 members and they meet from time to time either vitruallly
              or physically.For the online meetings ,they meet at least twice a week with a supervisor present who mostly helps them conduct the meeting in a n efficient manner.
              Even after the patients' completion of the rehabilitation process ,they still do the online meetings from time to time so as to help each other not to relapse back into addiction.The introduction of the online meetings was embraced 
              in 2020 ,when the Covid-19 pandemic arose.This was because we did not want to risk infection of all the patients in case anyone of them was infected.

          <h3 class="text-primary">Counselling</h3>
          <p>There are normally time to time Counselling sessions with the counsellors available within the vicinity.This is normally a very interactive session 
            where everyone gets to talk about their addictions ,what led them to those addictions ,what drove them into seeking for help at the rehabilitation center aand also what they would ant to do once they fully finish their rehab time
            and ate incorporated back into the society. 

          </p>
          <h3 class="text-primary">The 21 days program.</h3>
          <p>The 21-day alcohol and drug rehab program is intensive and focuses on the client who requires inpatient intervention and is specifically designed for those who need to return to work after a three week period.

            Once you have completed our program, we will assess your overall progress. If we or yourself feel you may need to stay on for longer, your program will be extended.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary">Aftercare</h3>
            <h4>What is aftercare?</h4>
            <p>Aftercare refers to any interventions following initial treatment.

              In the case of substance abuse treatment, it refers to the support given following discharge from a residential addiction treatment program.
              
              This is often in the form of attending support groups and meetings such as Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous, and continued substance abuse counselling.
              
              Aftercare and relapse prevention entails learning new coping strategies aimed at equipping addicts with the skills needed to help maintain their life of sobriety and minimise their risk of relapse.</p>

              <h4>Substance abuse treatment and aftercare programmes.</h4>
              <p>The quality of the rehab centre and your substance abuse treatment will have a strong influence on your chances of remaining sober.

                At Step Away Treatment Centre, we take pride in the fact that from the moment you enroll in one of our treatment programmes for alcoholism or drug addiction, our treatment team helps prepare you for the days following your successful completion of our rehabilitation programme.
                
                Essential to the aftercare process, our clients are encouraged to participate in our addiction support groups in order to remain connected and receive ongoing support for their continued addiction recovery.
                
                Addiction treatment is just the beginning and long term recovery requires a lifetime of commitment to healthy decisions and actions.</p>
